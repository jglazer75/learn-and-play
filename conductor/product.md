# Initial Concept
The project is "learn.play", an interactive video game history curriculum for a father and son.


# Product Definition

## Vision
To build a gamified, mobile-first web application that guides a father ("Historian") and son ("Apprentice") through a 50-week video game history curriculum, fostering connection through shared play and learning.

## Core Features
- **Setup Wizard ("Cartridge Creation"):** An initial configuration phase where the user defines the curriculum parameters, including duration (number of weeks), organization method (eras vs. genres), and feature toggles (side quests, high score tracking, etc.).
- **Curriculum Timeline:** A structured journey through video game history based on the user's configuration.
- **Gamification:** Engagement mechanics including XP, Levels, Streaks, and Badges to motivate progress.
- **Historian's Manual (AI):** A dynamic, magazine-style lesson generator powered by Google Gemini.
    - **Configurable Content:** Users can select specific "content blocks" (categories) for the AI to address.
    - **Visual Styling:** Options to select layout styles (mimicking classic gaming magazines) and color palettes (e.g., specific game themes).
- **Game Library:** A comprehensive resource of games in the curriculum.
- **Side Quests & Readlist:** Tracking for supplementary challenges and related media (books/movies).

## Design Principles
- **Mobile-First:** Optimized for handheld devices to ensure accessibility during play sessions.
- **Rich Media:** Integration of images and visual assets to create an immersive "magazine" feel.
