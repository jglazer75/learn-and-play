# Product Guidelines

## Prose Style
- **Educational & Structured:** The application uses clear, pedagogical language suitable for a historical curriculum. It prioritizes factual clarity to ensure the historical context is effectively communicated to both the "Historian" and the "Apprentice".

## Visual Identity
- **Adaptive Retro:** The visual style is configurable by the user, adapting to match the specific game or era being studied.
    - **Dynamic Themes:** Users can select from predefined themes that combine distinct asset styles (e.g., pixel art vs. low-poly polygons) and color palettes (e.g., "Mario" Red/Blue/Yellow vs. "Tomb Raider" Green/Brown/Blue) to evoke the correct atmosphere.

## Content Guidelines (Historian's Manual)
- **Deep Dive & Context:** AI-generated lessons provide extensive background on gaming eras, including developer insights and technological constraints.
- **Guided Experience:** The manual prioritizes "Dad Tips" and conversation starters to facilitate meaningful dialogue and shared learning between the father and son.
